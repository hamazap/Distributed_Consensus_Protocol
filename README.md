## 🔄 How It Works
The Distributed_Consensus_Protocol uses consensus algorithms to ensure that multiple systems can agree on the same data, even in challenging conditions. This is important in scenarios like banking systems, large online services, and cloud-based applications where consistency is crucial.

This application includes examples of:
- **Paxos:** A protocol that ensures a group of computers can agree on a single value.
- **Raft:** An algorithm designed to be easy to understand, which manages logs for distributed systems.
- **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance):** A protocol to handle faults in a distributed system, even when some members act maliciously.

The focus on fault tolerance and scalability helps ensure that your system remains functional and efficient under various conditions.

## 💡 Key Features
- **Multiple Consensus Protocols:** Easily switch between Paxos, Raft, and PBFT.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate through an intuitive interface designed for average users.
- **Extensive Documentation:** Detailed guides and FAQs are included to assist users.
- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor the performance and behavior of your system under different loads.

## 📊 Performance Evaluation
The application allows you to evaluate the performance of each consensus protocol. You can simulate various conditions and workloads to see how each protocol performs. This feature is useful for those studying distributed systems or wanting to understand the impacts of different architectures.
